# [Mixed Symbolic-Numeric Perturbation Theory](@id perturb_alg)

[**Symbolics.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) is a fast and modern Computer Algebra System (CAS) written in Julia. It is an integral part of the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) ecosystem of differential equation solvers and scientific machine learning packages. While **Symbolics.jl** is primarily designed for modern scientific computing (e.g. automatic differentiation and machine learning), it is also a powerful CAS that can be used for *classic* scientific computing. One such application is using *perturbation theory* to solve algebraic and differential equations.

Perturbation methods are a collection of techniques to solve hard problems that generally don't have a closed solution, but depend on a tunable parameter and have closed or easy solutions for some values of this parameter. The main idea is to assume a solution that is a power series in the tunable parameter (say $ϵ$), such that $ϵ = 0$ corresponds to an easy solution, and then solve iteratively for higher-order corrections.

The hallmark of perturbation theory is the generation of long and convoluted intermediate equations by this process. These are subjected to algorithmic and mechanical manipulations, which makes perturbation methods an excellent fit for a CAS. In fact, CAS software have been used for perturbation calculations since the early 1970s.

This tutorial shows how to mix symbolic manipulations and numerical methods to solve algebraic equations with perturbation theory. [Another tutorial applies it to differential equations](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/examples/perturbation/).

## Solving the quintic equation

The “hello world!” analog of perturbation problems is to find a real solution $x$ to the quintic (fifth-order) equation
```@example perturb
using Symbolics # load Symbolics.jl
@variables x # create a symbolic variable x
quintic = x^5 + x ~ 1 # create a symbolic representation of the quintic equation
```
According to Abel's theorem, a general quintic equation does not have a closed form solution. But we can easily solve it numerically using Newton's method (here implemented for simplicity, and not performance):
```@example perturb
function solve_newton(eq, x, x₀; abstol=1e-8, maxiters=50)
    # symbolic expressions for f(x) and f′(x)
    f = eq.lhs - eq.rhs # want to find root of f(x)
    f′ = Symbolics.derivative(f, x)

    xₙ = x₀ # numerical value of the initial guess
    for i = 1:maxiters
        # calculate new guess by numerically evaluating symbolic expression at previous guess
        xₙ₊₁ = substitute(x - f / f′, x => xₙ)
        if abs(xₙ₊₁ - xₙ) < abstol
            return xₙ₊₁ # converged
        else
            xₙ = xₙ₊₁
        end
    end
    error("Newton's method failed to converge")
end

x_newton = solve_newton(quintic, x, 1.0)
println("Newton's method solution: x = ", x_newton)
```

To solve the same problem with perturbation theory, we must introduce an expansion variable $\epsilon$ in the equation:
```@example perturb
@variables ϵ # perturbation expansion parameter
quintic = x^5 + ϵ*x ~ 1
```
If $\epsilon = 1$, we get our original problem. With $\epsilon = 0$, the problem transforms to the easy quintic equation $x^5 = 1$ with the trivial real solution $x = 1$ (and four complex solutions which we ignore). Next, expand $x$ as a power series in $\epsilon$:
```@example perturb
x_taylor = series(x, ϵ, 0:3) # expand x to third order
```
Then insert this into the quintic equation and expand it, too, to the same order:
```@example perturb
quintic_taylor = substitute(quintic, x => x_taylor)
quintic_taylor = taylor(quintic_taylor, ϵ, 0:3)
```
This equation must hold for each power of $\epsilon$, so we can separate it into one equation per order:
```@example perturb
quintic_eqs = taylor_coeff(quintic_taylor, ϵ)
```
These equations show three important features of perturbation theory:
1. The $0$-th order equation is *trivial* in $x_0$: here $x_0^5 = 1$ has the trivial real solution $x_0 = 1$.
2. The $n$-th order equation is *linear* in $x_n$ (except the trivial $0$-th order equation).
3. The equations are *triangular* in $x_n$: the $n$-th order equation can be solved for $x_n$ given only $x_m$ for $m<n$.
This structure is what makes the perturbation theory so attractive: we can start with the trivial solution $x_0 = 1$, then linearly solve for $x_n$ order-by-order and substitute in the solutions of $x_m$ for $m<n$ obtained so far. Let us write a function that solves a general equation `eq` for the variable `x` perturbatively with this *cascading* process:
```@example perturb
function solve_perturbed(eq, x, x₀, ϵ, order)
    x_taylor = series(x, ϵ, 0:order) # expand unknown in a taylor series
    x_coeffs = taylor_coeff(x_taylor, ϵ, 0:order) # array of coefficients
    eq_taylor = substitute(eq, x => x_taylor) # expand equation in taylor series
    eqs = taylor_coeff(eq_taylor, ϵ, 0:order) # separate into order-by-order equations
    sol = Dict(x_coeffs[1] => x₀) # store solutions in a symbolic-numeric map

    # verify that x₀ is a solution of the 0-th order equation
    eq0 = substitute(eqs[1], sol)
    if !isequal(eq0.lhs, eq0.rhs)
        error("$sol is not a 0-th order solution of $(eqs[1])")
    end

    # solve higher-order equations order-by-order
    for i in 2:length(eqs)
        eqs[i] = substitute(eqs[i], sol) # substitute lower-order solutions
        x_coeff = Symbolics.symbolic_linear_solve(eqs[i], x_coeffs[i]) # solve linear n-th order equation for x_n
        sol = merge(sol, Dict(x_coeffs[i] => x_coeff)) # store solution
    end

    return substitute(x_taylor, sol) # evalaute series with solved coefficients
end

x_pert = solve_perturbed(quintic, x, 1, ϵ, 7)
```
The $n$-th order solution of our original quintic equation is the sum up to the $\epsilon^n$-th order term, evaluated at $\epsilon=1$:
```@example perturb
for n in 0:7
    println("$n-th order solution: x = ", substitute(taylor(x_pert, ϵ, 0:n), ϵ => 1.0))
end
```
This is close to the solution from Newton's method!

## Solving Kepler's Equation

Historically, perturbation methods were first invented to calculate orbits of the Moon and the planets. In homage to this history, our second example is to solve [Kepler's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_equation), which is central to solving two-body Keplerian orbits:
```@example perturb
@variables e E M
kepler = E - e * sin(E) ~ M
```
We want to solve for the *eccentric anomaly* $E$ given the *eccentricity* $e$ and *mean anomaly* $M$.
This is also easy with Newton's method. With Earth's eccentricity $e = 0.01671$ and $M = \pi/2$:
```@example perturb
vals_earth = Dict(e => 0.01671, M => π/2)
E_newton = solve_newton(substitute(kepler, vals_earth), E, π/2)
println("Newton's method solution: E = ", E_newton)
```

Next, let us solve the same problem with our perturbative solver. It is most common to expand Kepler's equation in $M$ (the trivial solution when $M=0$ is $E=0$):
```@example perturb
E_pert = solve_perturbed(kepler, E, 0, M, 5)
```
Numerically, this gives almost the same answer as Newton's method:
```@example perturb
for n in 0:5
    println("$n-th order solution: E = ", substitute(taylor(E_pert, M, 0:n), vals_earth))
end
```
But unlike Newtons method, perturbation theory also gives us the power to work with the full *symbolic* series solution for $E$ (*before* numbers for $e$ and $M$ are inserted). Our series matches [this result from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation#Inverse_Kepler_equation):
```@example perturb
E_wiki = 1/(1-e)*M - e/(1-e)^4*M^3/factorial(3) + (9e^2+e)/(1-e)^7*M^5/factorial(5)
```

Alternatively, we can expand Kepler's equation in $e$ instead of $M$ (the trivial solution when $e = 0$ is $E=M$):
```@example perturb
E_pert′ = solve_perturbed(kepler, E, M, e, 5)
```
We can expand the trigonometric functions in $M$:
```@example perturb
E_pert′ = taylor(E_pert′, M, 0:5)
```
Up to order $e^5 M^5$, we see that this two-variable $(e,M)$-series also matches the result from Wikipedia:
```@example perturb
E_wiki′ = taylor(taylor(E_wiki, e, 0:5), M, 0:5)
```
